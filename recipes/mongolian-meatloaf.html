    <h1>Mangolian Meatloaf</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I could not be more pleased with how this Mongolian Meatloaf experiment turned out. Since I couldn’t decide whether to make meatloaf or Mongolian beef, I decided to try both things at once.
        <br>The result is a tender meatloaf, sliced and crisped in a skillet and served with a sweet, salty, savory sauce, which, like the American Chinese restaurant favorite, Mongolian Beef, is not remotely Mongolian
        <br>But it sure is delicious, especially served over steamed rice with bok choy.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For Meatloaf</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li> 1 cup diced yellow onion</li>
        <li> 3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li> 2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li> 1 cup cooked rice, cold or at room temperature</li>
        <li> 1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> 2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li> 4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup water</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li> 1 rounded teaspoon cornstarch</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To Serve</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> vegetable oil, as needed for frying</li>
        <li> toasted sesame seeds (optional)</li>
        <li> sliced green onions and chopped fresh cilantro (optional)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Step 1</b><br>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly oil a loaf pan.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b><br>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and sauté yellow onions with a pinch of salt until they start to turn golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cloves crushed garlic and 2 teaspoons ginger, and cook for 1 minute more. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b><br>Add cooled onion mixture to ground beef along with rice, egg, green onions, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, salt, and black pepper. Use a fork, spatula, or your hands to mix together until evenly combined. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan, press in firmly, and smooth the top.</li>
        <li><b>Step 4</b><br>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C), about 1 hour. Meatloaf can be served hot, or let cool, wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Step 5</b><br>For the sauce, combine 2 teaspoons oil, 1 tablespoon ginger, and 4 minced garlic cloves in a cold nonstick skillet.</li>
        <li><b>Step 6</b><br>Turn heat on to medium-high. Once ginger and garlic start to sizzle, cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, then whisk in brown sugar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup water, ketchup, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li><b>Step 7</b><br>Whisk 1 teaspoon cornstarch with 2 teaspoons water together in a small bowl to make a slurry; stir into the sauce. Raise heat to medium-high and return to a simmer. Cook, whisking occasionally, until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and keep warm until needed (Sauce may be made ahead and reheated on medium-low heat).</li>
        <li><b>Step 8</b><br>Remove cold meatloaf from the refrigerator and slice into 8 portions. Dust each side with cornstarch, and reheat over medium high heat in a nonstick skillet in a little bit of vegetable oil until browned and heated through. If surface browns before meatloaf is heated through, reduce heat to medium, and cover until done.</li>
        <li><b>Step 9</b><br>Serve topped with the sauce; garnish with toasted sesame seeds, sliced green onions, and chopped cilantro if desired.</li>
